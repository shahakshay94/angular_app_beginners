# angular_app_beginners
Simple todo-list MEAN Stack application. This angular App has some of the basic syntax. It also contains the node-js code. 
Nodejs Backend code is not written by me. I had downloaded the code from somewhere. If I find the link of the back-end code, I will post the link. 

# Steps to run angular app
1. npm install
2. ng serve
3. Open browser and goto localhost:4200

# Steps to run Nodejs app
1. npm install
2. node server.js

# make sure that your mongodb is running on it's default port.
